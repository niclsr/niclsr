## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Senior Artificial Intelligence Engineer with over 5 years of experience building intelligent systems at scale. I specialize in:

- 🤖 **LLM Systems** — LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, GPT-4, Claude
- 🔍 **RAG Architectures** — Real-time, semantic search pipelines with ChromaDB, Pinecone, pgvector
- 🧠 **Agentic Workflows** — Memory, planning, and tool-use orchestration
- 🧰 **Full-Stack Development** — React, Next.js, FastAPI, Supabase
- ☁️ **Cloud-Native ML Infrastructure** — Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS/GCP/Azure
- 📈 **ML Observability** — Drift detection, evaluation pipelines, prompt scoring

I build production-ready GenAI features that balance performance, creativity, and scalability—delivering measurable impact in logistics, healthcare, and SaaS platforms.
